B. Methodology
1.	We begin by collecting the city of Toronto data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
2.	We use python folium library to visualize geographic details of Toronto and its boroughs and create a map of Toronto with boroughs superimposed on top by using latitude and longitude values to get the visual as below;

3.	We will find all venues for each neighborhood using FourSquare API. 
 
4.	We will then filter out all 10 most common venues.
  
5.	Finally, we will visualize the ranking of the venues using python's Folium library.
