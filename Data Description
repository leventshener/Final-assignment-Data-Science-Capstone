 Data Description
To consider the problem we can list the datas as below:
•	The city of Toronto data that contains list Boroughs, Neighborhoods along with their latitude and longitude.
•	Venues in each neighborhood of the city of Toronto.
•	GeoSpace data
•	Forsquare API to get the most common venues of the city of Toronto.
B. Methodology
1.	We begin by collecting the city of Toronto data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
2.	We use python folium library to visualize geographic details of Toronto and its boroughs and create a map of Toronto with boroughs superimposed on top by using latitude and longitude values to get the visual as below;

3.	We will find all venues for each neighborhood using FourSquare API. 
 
4.	We will then filter out all 10 most common venues.
  
5.	Finally, we will visualize the ranking of the venues using python's Folium library.
